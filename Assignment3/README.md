# Assignment 3

Welcome to our third assignment!

### Access
You can open the assignment by downloading the notebook [(24W_CS188_Assignment3.ipynb)](./24W_CS188_Assignment3.ipynb) locally and upload it to Google [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

### Goals
## Goals
The goals of this assignment are to:

1. Build a Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch .
2. Build a Semantic Segmentation model using a ViT encoder

By the end of this assignment, you will have gained experience with:

- Working with PyTorch and the MiniPlaces dataset for image classification.
- Implementing and training different types of neural networks using PyTorch.
- Debugging and troubleshooting issues that may arise during the development process.

Please note that it may take some time to run the entire notebook and prepare the submission version. Make sure to allocate enough time for this task and start early. If you have any questions or run into any issues, please feel free to raise them in the Piazza forum or search the internet for debugging purposes. However, please do not directly copy code from other sources.

This assignment is due on ***Sunday, Mar 3rd***.

**Do not use any Code AI to finish the assignment.**

‚ùó**Once you have finished all the questions, it will still take approximately *60 minutes* to re-run the entire notebook in order to prepare the submission version. Make sure to allocate enough time for this task and start early.**

### Submission
Submit the completed notebook to BruinLearn. Make sure you have completed all the code implementations with all the results printed(marked as **Your Implementations **), and answered all the blanks at the end of each question.

Good luck and happy coding! Remember, the most important thing is to have fun and learn something new.
